# ForensiFeed

ForensiFeed is an automated tool for forensic investigation designed to parse social media feeds with real-time data extraction and documentation. 

## Problem Statement

In forensic investigations, accessing and examining social media accounts can be cumbersome. ForensiFeed aims to streamline this process by automatically parsing data and capturing screenshots of posts, messages, timelines, friend lists, following, followers, account info, and more. This reduces human error and facilitates thorough data review. The tool will support multiple social media platforms, including Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Telegram, WhatsApp, and Google accounts. Additionally, it will be available in both Android and Windows versions to address accessibility issues.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.\
The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.\
The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed!\
See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you are not satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project and copy all configuration files and transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point, you're on your own. You don't have to use `eject` if the curated feature set suits your needs.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
